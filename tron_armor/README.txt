======= Tron Armor Mod =========

Based on user stu's 3D armor mod, this mod was made to bring Tron Lightsuits to Minetest

Like stu's mod, this armor is suggested with the use of unified inventory or inventory plus.

The armor in this mod also offers healing, as well as fire protection. 
The mod can be edited throught the armor.conf located in the same folder as this file.
